# CloudBot (AKA Lurker)

A bot for Discord that keeps track of gametime of everyone in the server. Add the bot by clicking

and adding it to the server of your choice.

If you want to run your own version, you must create a new application on the Discord API, and use the above link except you replace the client_id with the client_id specified on your application.
